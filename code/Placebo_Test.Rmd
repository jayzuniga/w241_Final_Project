## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
d <- read.csv("./Article_Opinion_Label_Survey.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
d_df<-data.frame(d)
#group<- group_by(d_df,  success)
d_df <- d_df[-c(1,2),]
barplot(table(d_df[d_df$Group=='Treatment',]$Q3),main='Treatment Political Distribution',cex.names=.85)
barplot(table(d_df[d_df$Group=='Control',]$Q3),main='Control Political Distribution',cex.names=.85)
barplot(table(d_df[d_df$Group=='Treatment',]$Q4),main='Treatment Age Distribution',cex.names=.85)
barplot(table(d_df[d_df$Group=='Control',]$Q4),main='Control Age Distribution',cex.names=.85)
barplot(table(d_df[d_df$Group=='Treatment',]$Q1),main='Treatment Gender Distribution',cex.names=.85)
barplot(table(d_df[d_df$Group=='Control',]$Q1),main='Control Gender Distribution',cex.names=.85)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
